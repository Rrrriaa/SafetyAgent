This Welding Torch with Flames provides a welding tool with two flame variations.

Simply load the example scene - Welding_Torch_with_Flames.unity - or drag one of the Welding Torch prefabs from the Prefabs folder into the Hierarchy window.

The effect includes audio, however if you wish to disable this then expand out the effect in the Hierarchy window (click the grey triangle to left of its name), select the audio file, then untick it in the Inspector window (the top left of the window).

You may wish to change the size of the flames, in which case simply scale the flames mesh; expand out the effect in the Hierarchy window, select the flames mesh (either Welding_Torch_Flame_A or Welding_Torch_Flame_B), press the "r" key, then drag the manipulator.

Have fun!
